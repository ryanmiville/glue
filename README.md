# Glue

This is a simple CLI to interact with glue jobs. 

At the time, it has one command: `glue backfill`. It will run a glue job for each day between a start and end date.

## Prerequisites

You have the AWS CLI installed and your default profile has access to the Glue job.

## Usage

Here's an example using a fake job for the sake of time. (use `glue backfill` instead of `glue_backfill`)
